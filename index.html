     <h1>NYC311 Data</h1>
     <h2>Average Resolution Time for HPD Requests in 2017 by Community Board and Borough</h2>
     <main>
       Created as a part of <b>BetaNYC's NYC311 Data Jam</b> on September 23, 2017. Our challenge was find how NYC 311 service requests highlight neighborhood trends and monitor affordable housing in a way that is useful for community boards.
       <br /><br />
       Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) requests make up the majority of 311 complaints, and include things like heat and hot water complaints, water leaks, mold, pests, and appliance complaints. I created the below visualization using Tableau to allow community boards (CBs) to compare how HPD is performing in their district compared to others in their borough and others in the city.
       <br /><br />
       The data includes all HPD-related 311 requests to date in 2017. Each circle represents one community board district. Darker circles represent a higher number of requests in that CB district (you will note that the winter months tend to have darker circles, as significantly more heat/hot water complaints are made in winter and these make up the majority of complaints). The Y-axis shows the average number of days from when a 311 request is created until it is closed. It's interesting to see such a large deviation between community boards even within the same borough. You can hover over each circle to see the details: which CB, average days resolution time, and total number of HPD-related 311 requests.
